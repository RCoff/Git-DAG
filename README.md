# Git-DAG

Note: This project is still in its early stages.

## What is This?

At its core Git is a content addressable database. Git-DAG allows you to view this database as a 3d model.


Right clicking a commit node expands the model, displaying the tree. You can also right click references, trees and blobs, which will display the objects content (runs git cat-file).


You can also use the tool to visualize what various git commands are doing.
